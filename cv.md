My goal and priorities: to get good skills that will allow me to work remotedly in front-end sphere. 
My strengths are: 
- good ability to learn and gain new skills;
- keen attention to details;
- commitment to terms, tasks and deadlines.

Code example: 
`function compose() {
            let funcs = Array.from(arguments);
            return function (x) {
              if (funcs.length 	< 1) return x;
              let f = funcs[funcs.length - 1](x);
              for (let i = funcs.length - 2; i ≥ 0; i--) {
                f = funcs[i](f);
              }
              return f;
            };
            }`
